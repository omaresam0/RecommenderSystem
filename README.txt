----Item Based, User Based, Content Based----

To run itemBased/UserBased together run CF_Main.py 
To run contentBased run CB_Main.py
-----------------------------------------------

----SVD----
Run main.py
Note: surprise folder in the svd folder is the surprise
library that i had to use git repo to install it. However,
you might not need that folder and the library might be
easy to be installed successfully from the IDE itself. 
its better to try removing the surprise folder and try installing it from the ide.
this is the github link i got it from: https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise
-----------------------------------------------

----KMEANS----

to get recommendation results run: main.py
to get accuracy results run: MeasureAccuracy.py
-----------------------------------------------

#Datset:
dataset file is in the code folder, however no need to
add it to any of the algorithms' folder because the
only two datafiles that are used are already there.
...
#Libraries:
installing libraries is simply done from the ide itself
by importing them since warning will arise on each
import line to import the library.

Thanks you.
